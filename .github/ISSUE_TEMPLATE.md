### Disclaimer (to save your and our time)
You intend to post an issue that is not a bug report nor a feature request. Great! We are always happy and open to discuss how 
the library or it's documentation can be improved.

However if you are new to Bluetooth Low Energy and do not know how to accomplish what you want â€” this is not the best place to
seek knowledge. It will be quicker for you and will save our time if you consider using Google first as there are plenty of
very good articles out there.

In case you are not very familiar with RxJava or how could you use RxAndroidBle in your use case you should search 
www.stackoverflow.com for tag `rxandroidble` as there are already quite a few questions asked (and answered!) which could
address your issue.

After reading the above disclaimer you can delete it. :)
